1. Install kubectl-ai
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/kubectl-ai

2. Prepare yaml file(s)

3. Use command:

```bash
cat prompt.txt yaml/app-secret-env.yaml | kubectl-ai --model gemini-2.5-flash --quiet > security_report.log
```

4. Check report in ``security_report.log``

Sample output:
 
security_report.log
